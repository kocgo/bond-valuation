## Bonds

Bonds are fixed income securities that you can invest in to earn (interest and lump-sum payments, depending on the bond's promised payoffs).

- Unlike Stocks, `Bonds` have a legal obligation to pay you the promised payoffs.
- From the issuer's standpoint, a `Bond` is essentially a loan.

## Bond Characteristics

- Price, aka Market Price is the amount you pay to buy (sell) the bond.
- Par Value is the amount owed at the bond's maturity. (aka Face Value, Redemption Value, Nominal Value, Principle)
- Coupon is the interest paid per period.
- Coupon rate is the coupon expressed as a percentage of the Par.
- Coupon Rate = Coupon / Par
- Coupon Rate is NOT the interest rate of the bond.
- Maturity refers to the lifetime of the bond. (aka Time to Maturity)
- Yield is the effective interest rate of the bond. It's the bond's IRR.
